# WashU Workday Extension

**üßë‚Äçüè´RateMyProfessor on Hover:** Displays RateMyProfessors.com information when users hover over professor names on workday's "Find Course Sections" page. It shows a direct link to the professor's rating page, as well as a preview of rate my professor rating and "would take again" rate.

**üè´Semester and Academic Level Selection:** Helps you click through the *tedious* "Find Course Sections" page in just one tap as users can select a specific academic semester (e.g., "Fall 2025") and multiple academic levels (e.g., "Undergraduate", "Graduate") to tailor the automation process. The selections will be saved, so you only need to do it once every semester!

**üé®Theme Customization:** Users can choose from predefined themes (Dark, Blue, Light) or create a "Custom" theme by selecting background & text colors.

Download it through Google Chrome's webstore.
